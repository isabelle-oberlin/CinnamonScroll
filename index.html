            <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it.</p>
       
        <div class="AliceThoughts">
            <p>"and what is the use of a book, without pictures or conversation?"</p>

    <div class="RabbitParagraph">   
        <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, 
        for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether 
        the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the 
        trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a 
        White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. 
        There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice 
        think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say 
        to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought 
        it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have 
        wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); 
        but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS 
        WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried 
        on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that 
        she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and 
        burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop 
        down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
