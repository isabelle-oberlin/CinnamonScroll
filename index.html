        <div class="textbox">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
            nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
            conversations in it. <br><span id="appearing">And what is the use of a book without pictures or
                conversations?</span><br>
            She was considering whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up
            and picking the daisies, when <span class="shockSize">suddenly</span>
            <br>
            <span id="runningRabbit">a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her!</span>
            <br>
            She ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole
            under the hedge.

            In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out
            again.

            The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then <br>
            <span id="dipping">dipped <br>suddenly<br><br>down,</span> <br>
            <br><br>
            so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself
