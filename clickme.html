                    thump! thump! <br><br>
                    down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. <br><br>
                    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was
                    all
                    dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight,
                    hurrying
                    down it. There was not a moment to be <span id="disappearing">lost: away</span> went Alice like the
                    wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it <span id="turned">turned a corner,</span>

        </section>

            <p id="rabbitTalk"> Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!</p>
            <p>She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she
                found
                herself in a long, low
                hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
            </p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <div class="textbox">
                <p>
                    There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way
                    down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how
                    she was ever to get out again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class='shockSize'>Suddenly</span> she came upon a little three-legged
                    table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing
                    on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first
                    thought was that it might belong to one of the
                    doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were
                    too large, or the key was too small, but at any
                    rate it would not open any of them. However, on
                    the second time round, she came upon a low
                    curtain she had not noticed before,
                    and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the
                    lock,and to her great delight it fitted!
                </p>

                <p>
                    <!--to come back here after watching behind the curtain-->
                    <a id="anchor">Alice opened the door</a> and found that it led into a
                    small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:
                    she knelt down and looked along the passage
                    into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she
                    longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
                    about among those beds of bright flowers and
                    those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; and even if my head
                    would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how
                    I
                    wish I could shut up like a <span class='pinTrigger'>telescope!</span> I think I could, if I only
                    know how to begin.' For, you see,
                    so
                    many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
                    indeed were really impossible.
                </p>
                <p>

                    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so
                    she went back to the table, half hoping she might find
                    another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting
                    people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle
                    on it, (`which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,)
                    and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the
                    words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large
                    letters.
                    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little
                    Alice was not going to do <span class='shockSize'>THAT</span> in a hurry. `No, I'll look
                    first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or
                    not'; for she had read several nice little histories about
                    children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts
                    and other unpleasant things, all because they would not
                    remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
                    such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it
                    too long; and that if you cut your finger <span class='shockSize'>VERY</span> deeply with
                    a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that,
                    if you drink much from a bottle marked <span id='trigger'>poison,</span> it is
                    almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
                    However, this bottle was <span class='shockSize'>NOT</span> marked `poison,' so Alice ventured to
                    taste it, and finding it very
                    nice,
                    (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee,
                    and hot
                    buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

                    What a curious feeling!' said Alice;
                    `I must be shutting up like a telescope.'
                    And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought
                    that
                    she was now the right size for going though the little door into that lovely garden. First, however,
                    she
                    waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous
                    about
                    this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a
                    candle. I
                    wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after
                    the
                    candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
                    After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once;
                    but,
                    alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden key, and
                    when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it
                    quite
                    plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it
                    was too
                    slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
                    `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to
                    leave
                    off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
                    and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she
                    remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was
                    playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But
                    it's no
                    use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to
                    make ONE respectable person!'
                    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in
                    it a
                    very small cake, on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. `Well, I'll eat
                    it,'
                    said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I
                    can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
                    She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on
                    the
                    top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she
                    remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so
                    much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite
                    dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
                    So she set to work, and very soon finished off the <span class="growTrigger">cake</span>.

            <div class="textbox" id="growingAlice">
                <span class='curiouser' id='curiouser'>'Curiouser and curiouser!' </span>cried Alice
                (she was so much surprised, that for
                the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English);<br> 'now I'm
                opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' <br>(for
                when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight,
                they were getting so far off). <br>`Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will
                put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't be
                able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you
                must manage the best way you can; --but I must be kind to them,' thought
                Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll
                give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'<br>

                '...Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!' <br>
                Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than<br> <br> <br><span
                    id="verticalStretch">nine feet high,</span> <br><br> <br> and
                she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
                Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden
                with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

                `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great girl like you,' (she might well say this),
                `to
                go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons
                of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the
                hall.
                `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. `I shall be
                punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!

                After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see
                what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid
                gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
                himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!'
                Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her,
                she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please, sir--' The Rabbit
                started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and
                skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
